# Introduction

This is an instance of an early version of my developing archetype. It was planned to be shipped with it, but it's not possible because it fucks up with cloud build and another arm64 specific stuff.

So here we are, developing what we need for RPI in a separated repository, a specific instance to apify controls and readings, creating the foundations for a fast development platform where we plan good and funny things.

To run the RPI-controller, just navigate to the root folder and execute:
    
    python run.py
